// Needs Analysis ***Sketch***
// This file is an attempt at an overview of functions needed


// takes in a line from Events.txt and breaks up into manageable parts
Event parseEvent(String eventLine)
// Returns an Event object

// take in a line from Stats.txt and breaks up into manageable parts
void parseStats(String statLine)
// operates on an Event object

// Generates data according to normal distribution?
// dayNum is probably not needed just sake of completeness...
Day generateData(Double mean, Double stdDev, Char type, int dayNum)
// Returns a Day object/array/datafile




Event {
// Data
String name   : <name>
Char type     : <Continuous, Discreet or E-discreet>
min    : <Integer if type==Discreet else Double with two decimals>
max    : <Same type as min>
String unit   : <unit of measurement>
Int weight    : <weight>
Double mean   : <mean of probability distribution>
Double stdDev : <standard deviation>

// Functions

}


// Could be an array of tuples or whatever
Day {
// Data
(String eventName, Int/Double freq)  : (<name>,<number of occurances over the day>)

// Functions

}


--- Above is brainstorm ---

Data that needs to be kept track of:

C events
D events
E events
^^^^^^^^ Inherited from Event


Day data:
- Individual days associated with each stat file
- Aggregate day data also associated with each stat file


This is very much a work in progress

Virus.java from W8 exercise wrote files like so:

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.*;
public class virus {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
  }
  String filename = ...
  PrintWriter o = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(filename))
  o.write("program, use \n for linebreaks etc")
}
